4. **FORMAL ANALYSIS USING ALLOY**: in this section you will include your Alloy model. We require you to comment on the model by discussing the purpose of the model, what you can prove with it and why what you prove is important given the problem at hand. You are also required to show one or more worlds obtained by running your model.
5. **EFFORT SPENT**: In this section you will include information about the number of hours each group member has worked for this document.
